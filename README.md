# Diamond Price Prediction

## Overview

The **Diamond Price Prediction** project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other relevant attributes. This model uses machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions, enabling users to estimate diamond prices based on input characteristics.

## Features

- Predict diamond prices based on characteristics like:
  - Carat
  - Cut
  - Color
  - Clarity
  - Depth
  - Table
  - X, Y, Z dimensions
- Model trained on a real-world dataset to ensure reliable predictions.
- Interactive interface for easy testing of predictions.
